## Azure Portal

The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools.

- Build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments.
- Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources.
- Configure accessibility options for an optimal experience.

It maintains a presence in every Azure datacenter, this way it is resilient to individual datacenter failures and avoids network slowdowns by being close to users. The Azure portal updates continuously and requires no downtime for maintenance activities.

## Azure Marketplace

It helps connect users with Microsoft partners, independent software vendors, and startups that are offering their solutions and services, which are optimized to run on Azure. Azure Marketplace customers can find, try, purchase, and provision applications and services from hundreds of leading service providers. All solutions and services are certified to run on Azure.
