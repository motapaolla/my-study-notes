# Correlation

The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients can range in value from −1 to +1. For the Pearson correlation coefficient to be +1, when one variable increases then the other variable increases by a consistent amount. This relationship forms a perfect line. The Spearman correlation coefficient is also +1 in this case.

If the relationship is that one variable increases when the other increases, but the amount is not consistent, the Pearson correlation coefficient is positive but less than +1. The Spearman coefficient still equals +1 in this case.

When a relationship is random or non-existent, then both correlation coefficients are nearly zero.

If the relationship is a perfect line for a decreasing relationship, then both correlation coefficients are −1.
