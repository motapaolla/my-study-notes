### Generative Models

What does “generative” mean in the name “Generative Adversarial Network”? 
“*Generative*” describes a class of statistical models that contrasts with 
*discriminative* models.

Informally:
- **Generative** models can generate new data instances.
- **Discriminative** models discriminate between different kinds of data instance

A generative model could generate new photos of animals that look like real animals, 
while a discriminative model could tell a dog from a cat. GANs are just one kind of 
generative model.

For example, models that predict the next word in a sequence are typically generative 
models (usually much simpler than GANs) because they can assign a probability to a 
sequence of words.

**Transfer learning**

Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a 
task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.

It is not exclusively an area of study for deep learning. Nevertheless, transfer learning is popular in deep learning given the enormous resources required to train deep learning models or the large and challenging datasets on which deep learning models are trained.
